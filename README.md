# DeepLearningSegmentation

The source code of the ENet is refer to https://github.com/davidtvs/PyTorch-ENet and optimized for different comparing scenario.

Our works:

1. Comparing results of different structures (design choices) based on ENet, which can see in ENet_design_choice_run_bash.ipynb file.

2. Comparing testing results of training with differnt parameters and dataset based on ENet, which can see the ENet_test_camvid.ipynb and ENet_test_cityscapes.ipynb file.

3. Comparing results of ENet and SegNet

4. Comparing results of ENet and CGNet

5. Comparing results of ENet and DeepLab v3

The source code of the CGNet is refer to https://github.com/wutianyiRosun/CGNet and optimized for different comparing scenario.

The source code of the SegGNet is refer to https://github.com/meetshah1995/pytorch-semseg and optimized for different comparing scenario.

The source code of the DeepLab v3 is refer to https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab and optimized for different comparing scenario.
